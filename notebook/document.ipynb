The Faculty of Technological\\nStudies was established in February 2020 (No. 2160/43 order under section 27(1), Universities\\nAct No. 16 of 1978) by the Ministry of Higher Education, Technology and Innovation of Sri\\nLanka.The Vavuniya Campus of the University of Jaffna has been elevated to a separate state\\nUniversity and established as the ”University of Vavuniya, Sri Lanka” by the extraordinary\\ngazette issued on 8th June 2021. Accordingly, the University of Vavuniya became the 17th\\nstate University in Sri Lanka effective from 1st August 2021.\\nThe permanent site of the University of Vavuniya is about ten kilometres away from Vavu-\\nniya in the Vavuniya-Mannar road at Sopalapuliyankulam, Pampaimadu. One hundred and\\nsixty acres of land was acquired and reserved for the construction of academic, administrative,\\nand residential buildings. Vavuniya in the southern part of the Northern Province is a melt-\\ning pot of cultures of the Vanni region and the north-central region of Sri Lanka. A culture\\nthat has been influenced and shaped by the Vanniyas (of whom the King Pandaravanniyan is\\na prominent example) this district has ties even with the Paduvankarai regions that extend\\nto the Southernmost part of the Northern and Eastern provinces - an indication of how the\\nVanniya people have contributed to the rich culture of the Tamil speaking societies of Sri\\nLanka. Vavuniya is renowned for its mild climate which provides a pleasant change from the\\nusual arid conditions of the coastal regions of the Northern and Eastern provinces. As such,\\nit provides an ideal setting for the Faculty of Applied Science, with a pleasant environment\\nto indulge in educational and extra-curricular activities. Further, as per present conditions,\\nVavuniya provides a strategic location that acts as a transit point for the movement of people\\nas well as various financial and industrial activities/processes. Thus, Vavuniya is expected to\\ngrow into a prominent financial and cultural hub in Sri Lanka.\\nThe Faculty of Applied Science as an academic organization has a flexible, friendly, and\\nconducive internal environment that allows for effective teaching, learning, and research. This\\nis due to the fact that the faculty has a unique signatured culture where the student and staff\\ninteractions are at an optimum reasonably high, where one-to-one attention is administered\\nto the students by the teachers. Further, the Faculty has very strong ties with the community\\nof Vavuniya and, it is seen as a key and prominent player in the advisory capacities of all\\ndevelopment endeavours taking place in the locality. The faculty of Applied Science of the\\nUniversity of Vavuniya consists of two Departments, namely Department of Physical Science\\nand Department of Bio-science.\\n1'),\n",

The marks assigned for these ICA will be taken for\\nthe computation of final marks.\\n(b) End-semester Examination (ESE) (Summative) will be arranged by the examination branch\\nat the end of each semester.\\nEvaluation of Theory Course: The final marks of a theory examination is evaluated by\\nadding the ICA and ESE with appropriate ratio assigned to both ICA and ESE. Hence the final\\nmark M1 for the theory course is defined as follows:\\nM1 = T × 70% + A1 × 30%\\nwhere T is the mark obtained in the end-semester theory examination, and A1 is the average\\nmark of the In-course Assessments.\\nEvaluation of Practical Course: The final mark of a practical examination is evaluated by\\ngiving 40% for In-course Assessment and 60% for the End-semester Examination. The final\\nmark M2 for the practical course is defined as follows:\\nM2 = P × 60% + A2 × 40%\\nwhere P is the marks obtained in the end-semester practical examination and A2 is the average\\nof the In-course Assessments.\\nEvaluation of Theory Course Unit with Practical Component: The final mark is eval-\\nuated using the individual marks obtained in the theory and practical examination. Students\\nobtaining less than 40% marks in either theory or practical will obtain ‘E’ grade, even if the\\naverage is greater than 40%. The final mark M for the course unit with theory and practical\\ncomponents is evaluated as follows:\\nM = Ct × M1 + Cp × M2\\nCt + Cp\\nwhere Ct and Cp are the credit value of the theory part and practical part of a course\\nrespectively.\\nEvaluation of Industrial Training\\nThe final marks evaluation of industrial training is assessed by the members of the evaluation\\npanel appointed by the Head of the Department with the approval of the Faculty Board and\\nshall contain a senior staff from the institution where the student obtains the training and\\ntwo senior staff at the Department of Bio-science.

The lowest grade of the\\ncomponent is given for the course unit if a component is failed.\\nGrade Point Average (GPA) for each level is the credit-weighted arithmetic mean of the\\nGrade Point Values which is formulated as\\nGPA =\\nP(ci × gi)\\nP ci\\nwhere ci is the number of credits for the ith course unit and gi is the grade point value for\\nthe ith course unit.\\nAny calculated GPA is rounded to the two decimal places. The Overall GPA (OGPA) for\\nthe degree programmes would be the credit weighted mean giving equal weight for all levels\\n(three levels for three-year bachelor degree and four levels for honours degree), computed to\\ntwo decimal places.'),\n",

If you trained a linear regression model on a bunch of examples where Y = 0 or \\n1, you might end up predicting some probabilities that are less than 0 or greater than \\n1, which doesn’t make sense. Instead, we’ll use a logistic regression model (or logit \\nmodel) which was designed for assigning a probability between 0% and 100% that Y \\nbelongs to a certain class.\\nHow does the math work?\\nNote: the math in this section is interesting but might be on the more technical side. \\nFeel free to skim through it if you’re more interested in the high-level concepts.\\nThe logit model is a modification of linear regression that makes sure to output a \\nprobability between 0 and 1 by applying the sigmoid function, which, when graphed, \\nlooks like the characteristic S-shaped curve that you’ll see a bit later.\\nPart 2.2: Supervised Learning II'),\n",

This hyperplane \\nneeds to (1) separate the data cleanly, with blue points on one side of the line and \\nred points on the other side, and (2) maximize the margin. This is an optimization \\nproblem. The solution has to respect constraint (1) while maximizing the margin as is \\nrequired in (2).\\nThe human version of solving this problem would be to take a ruler and keep trying \\ndifferent lines separating all the points until you get the one that maximizes the margin.\\nIt turns out there’s a clean mathematical way to do this maximization, but the specifics \\nare beyond our scope. To explore it further, here’s a video lecture that shows how it \\nworks using Lagrangian Optimization.\\nThe solution hyperplane you end up with is defined in relation to its position with \\nrespect to certain x_i’s, which are called the support vectors, and they’re usually the \\nones closest to the hyperplane.\\n2. What happens if you can’t separate the data cleanly?\\nThere are two methods for dealing with this problem.\\n2.1. Soften the definition of “separate”.\\nWe allow a few mistakes, meaning we allow some blue points in the red zone or some \\nred points in the blue zone. We do that by adding a cost C for misclassified examples \\nin our loss function. Basically, we say it’s acceptable but costly to misclassify a point.\\n2.2. Throw the data into higher dimensions.\\nWe can create nonlinear classifiers by increasing the number of dimensions, i.e. include \\nx², x³, even cos(x), etc. Suddenly, you have boundaries that can look more squiggly \\nwhen we bring them back to the lower dimensional representation.\\nPart 2.2: Supervised Learning II'),\n",

A3C is an \\nactor-critic algorithm that combines the best of both approaches we explored earlier: \\nit uses an actor (a policy network that decides how to act) AND a critic (a Q-network \\nthat decides how valuable things are).

How do we define the reward that we maximize in \\nour real lives? Beyond base pleasure and pain, our definition of reward also tends to include \\nmessy things like right and wrong, fulfillment, love, spirituality, and purpose.\\nThere has been an intellectual field dedicated to the question of what our objective functions \\nare or should be since ancient times, and it’s called moral philosophy. The central question \\nof moral philosophy is: what ought we do? How should we live? Which actions are right or \\nwrong? The answer is, quite clearly: it depends on your values.\\nAs we create more and more advanced AI, it will start to depart from the realm of toy \\nproblems like Atari games, where “reward” is cleanly defined by how many points are won \\nin the game,  and exist more and more in the real world. Autonomous vehicles, for example, \\nhave to make decisions with a somewhat more complex definition of reward. At first, reward \\nmight be tied to something like “getting safely to the destination\". But if forced to choose \\nbetween staying the course and hitting five pedestrians or swerving and hitting one, should \\nthe vehicle swerve? What if the one pedestrian is a child, or a gunman on the loose, or the \\nnext Einstein? How does that change the decision, and why? What if swerving also destroys \\na piece of valuable art? Suddenly we have a much more complex problem when we try to \\ndefine the objective function, and the answers are not as simple.\\nIn this series, we explored why it’s difficult to specify explicitly to a computer what a cat looks \\nlike - if asked how we know ourselves, the answer is, most simply, “intuition” - but we’ve \\nexplored machine vision approaches to teaching the machine to learn this intuition by itself. \\nSimilarly, in the domain of machine morality, it might be difficult to specify exactly how to \\nevaluate the rightness or wrongness of one action vs. another, but perhaps it is possible for a \\nmachine to learn these values in some way. This is called the values learning problem, and it \\nmay be one of the most important technical problems humans will ever have to solve.\\nFor more on this topic, see this synoptic post on the Risks of Artificial Intelligence. And as you \\ngo forth into the world of making machine smarter and smarter, we\\'d encourage you to keep \\nin mind that AI progress is a double-edged sword, of particular keenness on both sides.\\nPart 5: Reinforcement Learning'),\n",
